    "The dataset contains **10008 rows and 8 rows with 3446 missing values** before cleaning and validation. All the columns in the dataset have been validated according to the following criteria:\n",
    "- **Rua** (*address*): string values with 3434 missing values, representing 34,3% of the dataset. These were dropped, because the address is considered essential factor for price analysis, and it can be a key to identify other features, such as census data. House numbers were removed through string formatting for preventing home identification and preserving private household information.\n",
    "- **Bairro** (*ward*): string values with 12 missing entries. These were searched out within entries at the same addresses in the dataset. 11 were found, and 1 remained missing. The missing ward was googled. A dictionary of addresses and wards was created, and an apply lambda function was used to fill-in the missing values.\n",
    "- **Cidade** (*city*): non-null string values with a unique city count, confirming all data belongs to the city of Sao Paulo. No cleaning was necessary.\n",
    "- **Metragem** (*area/sqm*): float values representing property areas, without missing values. Summary statistics revealed right-skewed data and the presence of extreme outliers. Those were removed using interquartile based filtering.\n",
    "- **Quartos** (*bedrooms*): integer values representing the amount of bedrooms, without missing vales. Summary statistics revealed right-skewed data, and the presence of outliers. Those were removed using interquartile based filtering, expanding the interval to the nearest integer values.\n",
    "- **Banheiros** (*bathrooms*): integer values representing the amount of bathrooms, without missing vales. Summary statistics revealed right-skewed data, and the presence of outliers. Those were removed using interquartile based filtering, expanding the interval to the nearest integer values.\n",
    "- **Vagas** (*parking spaces*): integer values representing the amount of parking spaces, without missing vales. Summary statistics revealed right-skewed data, and the presence of outliers. Those were removed using interquartile based filtering, expanding the interval to the nearest integer values.\n",
    "- **Valor** (*property prices*): string values instead of float values representing property prices. All include currency info, and some include monthly/yearly arrangements, suggesting rental listings. With the purpose of keeping only sale listings, this column was split and expanded into three columns: \"Moeda\", \"Valor_Anuncio\" and \"Tipo_Anuncio\". Considering that \"Tipo_Anuncio\" would only contain complementary info on monthly/yearly arrangements, we kept only the entries that had null values on this column. After dropping the additional columns, renaming the column to \"Valor_BRL\" to aggregate the currency info, outliers were removed using interquartile based filtering.\n",
    "After the data validation, the dataset contains **5347 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.\n"
